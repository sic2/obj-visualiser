Wavefront (obj) loader

Overview

This is a basic .obj loader written in C. A C++ wrapper is included. It can parse vertices, texture coordinates, normals, 3 or 4 vertex faces, and .mtl files. There is also support for non-standard object types that are relevant to raytracing. See these pages for details on the standard obj and mtl format definitions.

Please contact me if you have any suggestions for improvements.

The code and tests for the loader is available here. Some sample scenes are also available:

test.obj and test.mtl
cornell_box.obj and cornell_box.mtl

The code is free and public domain.
You may use it as you desire.
No credit is needed. Enjoy!

Bug reports are welcome, of course.
